Massachusetts State Data Center

Staffed by members of the Economic and Public Policy Research group and led by State Data Center manager Carrie Bernstein at the UMass Donahue Institute, the Massachusetts State Data Center is part of the national State Data Center (SDC) Network, a cooperative program between the states and the U.S. Census Bureau to make data locally accessible.

The SDC programâ€™s mission is to provide easy and efficient access to all U.S. Census Bureau data and information through agencies in each state. The Massachusetts SDC maintains its own network of Massachusetts affiliates including state agencies, universities, libraries, and regional and local governments which it relies on to provide local knowledge and expertise.

Across the U.S., State Data Centers are the official local sources of demographic, economic and social statistics produced by the U.S. Census Bureau. The Massachusetts State Data Center helps people access U.S. Census Bureau information, including the American Community Survey, Decennial Census, Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics, County Business Patterns, and Annual Building Permit data sets, among others. For those interested in accessing and using Census Bureau data, the SDC also provides training and technical assistance.
